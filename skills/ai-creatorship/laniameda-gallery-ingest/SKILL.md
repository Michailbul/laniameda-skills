# laniameda-gallery-ingest

Use this skill to ingest content into `laniameda.gallery` through the canonical backend contract in this repo.

The skill now supports explicit `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations through the same script entrypoint.

## Read first

Before constructing payloads or changing the ingest script, read these repo files:

- `convex/schema.ts`
- `convex/validators.ts`
- `convex/ingest.ts`
- `convex/agent_ingest.ts`
- `app/api/ingest/route.ts`

Use `references/schema-contract.md` for a quick map and `references/ingest-examples.md` for copy-ready examples.

## Source of truth

- Canonical skill source: `skills/laniameda-gallery-ingest/`
- Installed copies under `~/.openclaw/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, and `~/.agents/skills/` are disposable `bunx skills` installs.
- When ingest contracts change, update this skill in the same commit.

## Runtime env

The script reads these env vars at runtime:

- `KB_OWNER_USER_ID` — required. Keep this env-driven; do not hardcode the owner in payloads or wrappers.
- `CONVEX_URL` — required; falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` if present.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` — optional browser/runtime mirror for app environments; keep it aligned with `CONVEX_URL`.

Use a single active Convex deployment across OpenClaw, local dev, and Vercel. Do not hardcode deployment names in workflow docs; rotate the env values instead.

## Supported content

- Prompt-only saves with explicit `allowPromptOnly: true`
- File uploads from local disk or inline base64 (images AND videos)
- Remote URL ingestion (images AND videos)
- Design inspiration records for non-prompt design references, including extension-style metadata like `sourceTitle`, `userNote`, `captureKind`, `saveIntent`, `templateKey`, and `sourceFingerprint`
- **Video prompts**: prompts for AI video generation tools (e.g. Seedance 2.0) with attached `.mp4` / `.mov` / `.webm` output
- Batched ingestion via JSON array
- Metadata updates for prompts, assets, and design inspirations
- Idempotent deletes for prompts, assets, and design inspirations
- Automatic pack sync for multi-asset prompt variations that share a prompt record

## Semantic search

All ingested assets and prompts are automatically indexed for semantic search using Gemini multimodal embeddings (`gemini-embedding-2-preview`).

- **Image assets** are embedded as pure image data (no text metadata). A text query like "car" matches images that visually contain cars via cross-modal matching.
- **Prompts** are embedded as prompt text only (no tags/pillar/model padding).
- **Tags and metadata** are applied as post-filters, not included in embeddings.
- Search via `semanticSearch:searchAssets` (text → assets) or `semanticSearch:findSimilarAssets` (image → similar images).
- Backfill after schema changes: `npx convex run semanticIndex:backfillBatch '{"sourceType": "asset", "batchSize": 25}'` (loop until `done: true`).

## CRITICAL: Screenshots and prompt images

When Michael sends a **screenshot of a prompt** or **image containing text/JSON**:
- **DO NOT** use that image as the `imagePath` or asset
- **DO** read the image, extract the text/prompt from it, and put it in `finalPrompt`
- The image is the delivery mechanism, not the content
- The content is the prompt text inside it

Only use an image as `imagePath`/asset when it is a **generated output** (the result of a prompt), not when it contains text or code to be saved.

## Video prompts (Seedance 2.0 and other AI video models)

Video generations ingest through the **same script and payload shape** as images. The only differences:

- Use `imagePath` / `filePath` / `url` pointing at a video file (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.webm`). The server detects `video/*` content-type automatically and stores the asset with `kind: "video"`.
- Set `generationType: "video_gen"` and `promptType: "video_gen"`.
- Default `modelName` to `"Seedance 2.0"` when not specified. Pair with `modelProvider: "other"` unless a listed provider applies.
- A poster/thumbnail is **not** generated automatically for videos. If you want a custom still for the gallery card, ingest the video first, then run the `update` op on the asset with an `imagePath` pointing at a still frame to replace the thumbnail.
- The same prompt-only rule applies: **never save a video prompt without the video file unless the user explicitly approves** `allowPromptOnly: true`.

Example:

```bash
bun run ~/.agents/skills/laniameda-gallery-ingest/scripts/ingest.ts '{
  "pillar": "creators",
  "promptText": "cinematic dolly-in on a neon-lit alleyway, rain falling, 5 seconds",
  "promptType": "video_gen",
  "generationType": "video_gen",
  "modelName": "Seedance 2.0",
  "modelProvider": "other",
  "imagePath": "/path/to/output.mp4",
  "ingestKey": "creators:neon-alley-dolly:v1",
  "tagNames": ["video", "cinematic", "neon"]
}'
```

Batched video prompt variations use the same `promptIngestKey` pattern as images — variants auto-group into an `assetPack`.

## CRITICAL: Never save without an image unless user approves

**Do NOT use `allowPromptOnly: true` without explicit user approval.** This is a hard rule — no exceptions, no silent fallbacks.

If you cannot attach an image (no file path, inline-only attachment, broken URL, extraction failure):
1. **Stop.** Do not ingest.
2. **Tell the user** exactly why the image is missing.
3. **Ask:** "Should I save the prompt without the image, or do you have a file path for it?"
4. Only proceed with `allowPromptOnly: true` if the user explicitly says yes.

When ingesting from PDFs, documents, websites, or any source that contains both prompts and images:
1. **Always extract images** alongside prompts — never skip them
2. **Match each prompt to its image** by order/position in the source
3. If images are too large (>5MB), compress to JPEG before uploading
4. **If images cannot be fetched or extracted, stop and ask the user** — never silently drop images

Common trap: user shares an image inline in a chat conversation. You cannot extract inline attachments to a file path. **Ask the user for the local file path before ingesting.** Do not save prompt-only and "attach later" — get the path first.

## Payload rules

- Always provide content: `promptText`, `promptSections.finalPrompt`, `url`, `filePath` / `imagePath`, or `designInspiration`.
- **Default: include `imagePath` or `filePath` with every prompt.** Never set `allowPromptOnly: true` without asking the user first.
- Always set `pillar` when possible.
- Prefer `typedTags` when category and source are known.
- Use stable `ingestKey` values for retry safety.
- Use `promptIngestKey` when multiple assets should attach to one prompt.
- Reusing one `promptIngestKey` across multiple media ingests now creates or updates an `assetPack` automatically.
- Keep `ownerUserId` env-driven; callers never pass it directly.
- `ingestKey` is only an idempotency key for `create`; it does not patch existing records.
- For `update` and `delete`, pass `target` plus either `id` or `ingestKey`.
- Design inspiration create/update payloads may include `sourceTitle`, `userNote`, `captureKind`, `saveIntent`, `templateKey`, `sourceFingerprint`, and `status` when the source carries that metadata.
- `update` supports media attachment for prompts (`target: "prompt"` + `imagePath`/`filePath`) and media replacement for assets (`target: "asset"` + `imagePath`/`filePath`).
- When attaching media to a prompt, an `assetIngestKey` is derived as `${ingestKey}:img` by default, or can be set explicitly.
- Re-uploading media with the same `assetIngestKey` replaces the existing asset's file rather than creating a duplicate.
- Legacy rows can be backfilled into explicit packs with `assetPacks:consolidateOwnerPromptPacks`.

## Install/update workflow

Repo-local development:

```bash
bun run skills:install:local
```

GitHub-backed install:

```bash
bun run skills:install:github
```

Refresh installed GitHub-backed skills:

```bash
bun run skills:update
```

These repo scripts now install/update both maintained gallery skills:

- `laniameda-gallery-ingest`
- `laniameda-gallery-query`

## Validator quick reference

These are the valid enum values the Convex schema enforces — use these or ingest will fail:

**`modelProvider`:** `openai`, `anthropic`, `google`, `xai`, `meta`, `flux`, `midjourney`, `runway`, `other`
→ Use `other` for Kora Reality / Enhancor and any non-listed providers.

**`workflowType`:** `component_prompt`, `page_prompt`, `system_prompt`, `asset_recipe`, `other`

**`typedTags[].category`:** `model_name`, `style`, `content_type`, `platform`, `color`, `camera_angle`, `lighting`, `composition`, `car_make`, `car_model`, `car_angle`, `environment`, `design_style`, `design_type`, `workflow_type`, `component_type`, `custom`
→ No `subject` — use `content_type` instead.

**`promptSections` fields:** `finalPrompt` (required), `generationNotes` (optional), `negativePrompt` (optional)
→ No other keys — extra fields cause validation errors.

## Update workflow (important)

**Always edit the canonical source first:**

```
~/work/laniameda/laniameda.gallery/skills/laniameda-gallery-ingest/SKILL.md
```

Then push to GitHub:

```bash
cd ~/work/laniameda/laniameda.gallery
git add skills/laniameda-gallery-ingest/
git commit -m "update laniameda-gallery-ingest skill"
git push
```

Then refresh installed copies across all agents:

```bash
bun run skills:update
# or manually:
bunx skills add https://github.com/laniamedaHQ/laniameda-gallery/tree/main/skills/laniameda-gallery-ingest -g -a openclaw -a codex -a cline -y
bunx skills add https://github.com/laniamedaHQ/laniameda-gallery/tree/main/skills/laniameda-gallery-query -g -a openclaw -a codex -a cline -y
```

**When Michael says he pushed updates to the gallery repo:**
Run this immediately:
```bash
cd ~/work/laniameda/laniameda.gallery && git pull && bun run skills:update
```
No need to ask — just pull and update.

Installed copies at `~/.openclaw/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` are **disposable** — source of truth is always the repo.

## Script

Example invocation:

```bash
CONVEX_URL=https://<your-laniameda-deployment>.convex.cloud KB_OWNER_USER_ID=278674008 \
  bun run ~/.agents/skills/laniameda-gallery-ingest/scripts/ingest.ts '{"promptText":"cinematic portrait","pillar":"creators","allowPromptOnly":true}'
```

If env vars are already set in `.env`, you can omit the inline prefix.

If the installed path is different for your agent runtime, use that runtime's installed `laniameda-gallery-ingest/scripts/ingest.ts` path instead.
